                While fiberglass smooth doors can be painted, a fiberglass textured door offers a wood like appearance with four times the strength of a wood door. Plus, they resist splitting, cracking and rot.
                With their higher insulation values and durability, fiberglass doors are a smart long-term investment for your home.
